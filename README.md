# PCA_QDA_Diabetes_STA135

Goal is to predict diabetes onset in female Pima Indians using historical medical data. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, sourced from the 'mlbench' package in R, comprises medical diagnostic measurements from women of Pima Indian descent. This dataset serves to investigate diabetes prevalence and its predictors within this high-risk group.


Goal is to using some techniques from multivariate data analysis such as LDA, QDA, PCA or factor analysis. If PCA is being used, what are the PCs? How many PCs do you want to choose? Can you interpret the PCs and use them for ranking? For another example, if you are using LDA/QDA, which method do you choose? What is the decision boundary? What is the confusion matrix? Does the splitting of training and test data sets affect my results?
